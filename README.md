# Customer Reward points summary

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem statement

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.  

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction. 

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points). 
â€¯ 
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
